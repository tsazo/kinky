					<p>Hi I'm Trinity Sazo and welcome to Kinky, a brand new literary magazine on the topic of hair.</p>
					<p>You might be wondering why hair? I will take you on my own personal journey on how hair has shaped my life, from how I carried myself as a growing girl to how I viewed the world around me. In brief, I used to despise my hair. Kinky, bring the essence of self love and help readers achieve the same mindset I find myself in now.</p>
					<p>Kinky is available to all in order to view the world in a familiar yet unusual lens. Our mission is to spread body positivity through articles and opinion pieces that reflect how intolerance for oneself and others can lead to why most controversies exist. If we can help readers accept not only themselves but the variety and uniqueness of others, then we are able to start piecing away at the toxic mindset that there is a singular way to live life. Serving as a liberal magazine, we strive to embrace all persons and “untangle” the knots present in the world starting with the hair on our heads. </p>
					<p>As a literary magazine, Kinky will allow readers to broaden their views to the lives of individuals and groups by keeping the focal point on hair: if readers can understand that the type of hair we are born with is out of our control, then we can start to conceptualize the issues generated by race and general appearances are therefore also out of our control. Through such measures, we can establish not simply tolerance, but acceptance of each other as humans.</p>
					<p>We hope that readers will not only find themselves wanting to spark a change in their lives, but also spread the positivity outward to their family, friends, and acquaintances.</p>
					<p>You get to choose how to explore the magazine. Whether you want to understand how hair is related to more than simply fashion or simply come to view a different perspective, you can learn how to embrace yourself and those around you. We leave your journey in your own hands.</p>
					<p>This issue includes discussion on symbolism of hair in literature and how that connects to the real world. Elizabeth Acevedo is introduced in this issue as our featured author, presenting her stellar piece "Hair." Prose from all kinds of writers, college students and professional journalists, all touch on the representations of hair in various types of literature, specifically magazines and children's books and the professional world around us.</p>
					<p>In the future, we hope to have an issue about hair and the Bible, Koran, and other religious writings. Another issue will focus primarily on hair in Hollywood: movies, models, dancers, and singers.</p>
					<p>Best,</p>
					<p>Trinity Sazo</p>
					<p>Kinky Co.</p>
